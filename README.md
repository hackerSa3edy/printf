## Description

This project provides a custom implementation of the `printf` function in C. The `printf` function is widely used for formatted output in C programming. This implementation aims to replicate the functionality of the standard `printf` function, supporting various format specifiers and flags.

## Features

- Supports various format specifiers:
    - `"c"`: prints a character.
    - `"s"`: prints a string.
    - `"r"`: prints a string in reverse.
    - `"R"`: prints a string in ROT13.
    - `"d"`: prints an integer.
    - `"i"`: prints an integer.
    - `"u"`: prints an unsigned integer.
    - `"x"`: prints a number in hexadecimal (lowercase).
    - `"X"`: prints a number in hexadecimal (uppercase).
    - `"o"`: prints an octal number.
    - `"b"`: prints the binary representation of an unsigned decimal.
    - `"S"`: prints a string with non-printable characters replaced by their ASCII code in hexadecimal.
    - `"p"`: prints a pointer address.

    If the specifier provided does not match any of the above, the function returns `NULL`.

- Handles flags such as:
    - `#`: This is the "alternate form" flag. When this flag is set, `printf` modifies the output of 'o', 'x', 'X', 'a', 'A', 'e', 'E', 'f', 'F', 'g', and 'G' type specifiers with different behaviors for each specifier.

    - `' '` (space): This flag is used to insert a space before the output when positive signed types are converted and no sign is going to be written. It's ignored if the '+' flag exists.

    - `+`: This flag forces the output to be prepended with a plus or minus sign (+ or -) even for positive numbers. By default, only negative numbers are preceded with a - sign.

## Installation

To use this custom `printf` function in your project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/hackerSa3edy/printf.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd printf
    ```

3. Compile the source files:
    ```sh
    gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o printf
    ```

    - The command `gcc` is used to compile C files. Here's what each flag does:

        - `Wall`: Enables all the commonly used warning messages about potential issues in your code. Itâ€™s a good practice to use this option to catch possible errors early.
        - `Werror`: Treats all warnings as errors. This means that if the compiler encounters any warnings, it will stop the compilation process. This helps ensure that your code is free of warnings.
        - `Wextra`: Enables additional warning messages that are not included with -Wall. These warnings can help catch more subtle issues in your code.
        - `pedantic`: Enforces strict compliance with the C standard. This option generates warnings for any code that does not adhere to the standard, ensuring portability and correctness.
        - `std=gnu89`: Specifies the standard to which the code should conform. In this case, it sets the standard to GNU89, which is the GNU dialect of the 1989 ANSI C standard. This includes some GNU-specific extensions.

        - `*.c`: This is a wildcard that matches all files in the current directory that end with the `.c` extension. These are the files that will be compiled.

        - `-o printf`: This flag is followed by the name of the output file. In this case, the output file will be named `printf`. If this flag is not used, the output file is named `a.out` by default.


## Usage

Include the header file in your C program:
```c
#include "main.h"
```

Use the custom printf function as you would with the standard printf:
```c
int main(void)
{
    _printf("Hello, World!\n");
    _printf("Number: %d\n", 42);
    return 0;
}
```
